Every staged file is tracked, but not vice-versa.
A tracked file in Git simply
means that is "on the radar" of Git,
in other words Git 
follows the versioning of the file.
To understand better what a tracked file is we can
consider what an untracked file is. 
An untracked file on your local system is not versioned,
and therefore is not present on 
the remote Git repository. To Git, an 
untracked file does not really exist,
though to you it does exist, 
at least on your local file systemi
